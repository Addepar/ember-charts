# Ember Charts

A charting library built with the Ember.js and d3.js frameworks. It includes
time series, bar, pie, and scatter charts which are easy to extend and modify.
The out-of-the-box behavior these chart components represents our thoughts on
best practices in chart interactivity and presentation.

## Contributing

Got something to add? Great! Bug reports, feature ideas, and (especially) pull
requests are extremely helpful, and this project wouldn't be where it is today
without lots of help from the community.

opening issues and working on the project.


## Versioning

Ember Charts uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to keep track of
releases using the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

In a nutshell, this means:
* Breaking changes to the API or behavior increases the major version
* Adding functionality in a backwards-compatible way increases the minor version
* Making backwards-compatible bug fixes increases the patch version
