# Ember Charts [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Addepar/ember-charts.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Addepar/ember-charts)

A charting library built with the Ember.js and d3.js frameworks. It includes
time series, bar, pie, and scatter charts which are easy to extend and modify.
The out-of-the-box behavior these chart components represents our thoughts on
best practices in chart interactivity and presentation.

## Getting Started

#### JS Bin Starter Kit

http://emberjs.jsbin.com/rekawobugu/1/edit

Unfortunately, this version of Ember Charts is out of date,
but the current maintainers of Ember Charts at Addepar have not been
able to update it recently.

#### Installation with Ember CLI (Recommended)

Ember Charts is an Ember CLI addon published to the public NPM
repository at https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-charts ,
so it can be installed like so:

```bash
# ember-cli >= 0.2.0
ember install:addon ember-charts

# ember-cli >= 0.2.3
ember install ember-charts
```

Once it's installed, you can customize the look of Ember Charts with CSS.

#### Installation with Bower (Globals-Based Version)

```bash
npm install -g bower      # install Bower
bower install ember-charts --save
```

Or, just include `dist/ember-charts.js` and `dist/ember-charts.css` in your app.

Using Ember Charts with bower is **deprecated** and will eventually be removed.
We recommend that you migrate your apps to Ember CLI! Documentation has been
updated to show Ember CLI usage. If you need documentation for globals-based
use, please check out version 0.5.0 of Ember Charts and follow the setup
instructions under "Running Old Versions" to display the old guides.

#### Developing or Testing

After cloning this repo, install dependencies and run the demo application:

```bash
npm install
bower install
ember serve
```

Now you can:
- View the demos and read the documentation: http://localhost:4200
- Run tests: http://localhost:4200/tests

As noted in the full [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md),
before submitting a pull request, please compile the globals-based version of
Ember Charts (the `dist` folder):

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli      # install grunt
grunt dist
```

## Dependencies
* ember
* lodash
* d3
* jquery-ui


## Browser Support

We aim to support the last two major versions of every common browser.

If you need to support further browsers, we welcome pull requests with fixes.

Touch support may work but has not been tested.


## Contributing

Got something to add? Great! Bug reports, feature ideas, and (especially) pull
requests are extremely helpful, and this project wouldn't be where it is today
without lots of help from the community.

Please read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for directions on
opening issues and working on the project.


## Versioning

Ember Charts uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to keep track of
releases using the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

In a nutshell, this means:
* Breaking changes to the API or behavior increases the major version
* Adding functionality in a backwards-compatible way increases the minor version
* Making backwards-compatible bug fixes increases the patch version


## Releasing a New Version (For Maintainers)
Update version numbers and release using https://github.com/webpro/grunt-release-it:

```bash
vim CHANGELOG.md
grunt release-it:<options>
npm publish # access needed to publish new Addepar-owned npm packages
```

By default, `grunt release-it` without options will increment the
<patch> version number (X.Y.Z --> X.Y.(Z+1)) in the `VERSION` file,
update the globals-based version of Ember Charts, and then commit
the resulting changes to the ember-charts git repository.

If you want to control the version number, use these options:

```bash
grunt release-it:minor
grunt release-it:major
grunt release-it:X.Y.Z
```

Ember Charts uses the "distribution repository" feature of `grunt release-it` to push to
the `gh-pages` branch of the ember-charts git repo, from which the demo and documentation
website is automatically published.

When prompted by `grunt release-it`, do NOT update the tag for the
distribution repository OR publish to npm (the latter will try to publish the `gh-pages`
branch, not the `master` branch; npm publishing is done in the separate command
above). We'll streamline the release process a bit more soon.
